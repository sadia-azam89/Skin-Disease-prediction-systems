here i design and implement a skin disease prediction system based on machine learning using the dataset of Dermnet.
Leveraging machine learning techniques, this research focuses on enhancing diagnosis accuracy by selecting and analyzing the top 10 prevalent skin diseases out of the 23 included in the Dermnet dataset. 
The proposed expectation framework coordinates different stages, including information assortment, preprocessing, highlight extraction, model preparation, and prediction.
It has the potential to transform dermatological practice by utilizing machine learning to enable early identification, proactive intervention, and personalized care for patients with skin conditions. 
The technology can also help medical practitioners make wise choices, minimize diagnostic mistakes, and improve treatment plans. 
There are several machine learning algorithms that can be used for the prediction but after experimenting and evaluating the results, we used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for our system. 
The resulting prediction system demonstrates quite accurate results, proving to be a valuable tool for dermatologists and healthcare professionals.
